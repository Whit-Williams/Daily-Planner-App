# The Daily Planner App

Welcome to my Daily Planner App.

Following on from last week's lesson on third party APIs, I have created a daily planner application using JQuery, Bootstrap and Day.js.

## About The Project

More specifically, the task for this challenge was to build a planner app with timeslots that allow you to add event text and save for later retrieval. Upon opening the application, the current day's date and time would be updated dynamically, and the timeslots would change colour to indicate whether the time slot had passed, was the current hour or yet to come.
